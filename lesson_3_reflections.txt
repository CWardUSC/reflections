When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    All of the time. There are obvious benefits for working with a team or getting code
    review or advice from others, but even for individual projects it serves as a form
    of backup and enables you to pull it on any computer you're working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There are a number of possible scenarios where you wouldn't want the local repository
    to be up to date with the remote, but probably the most common is you're working on
    something that conflicts with the changes that have been made to the remote. In general,
    manually controlling the flow of the data enables more fine grained possibilities.
