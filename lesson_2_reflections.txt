What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a new repository directory, .git, in the directory you created
	the repository in. This enables you to start committing and working with
	the repository by providing the framework repository structure, config,
	etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It enables you to prepare files that you've worked on and want to include 
	as part of a commit without actually committing them immediately. You're
	less likely to forget to include them in the commit if you can stage them
	immediately. Looking simply at changed files may not tell you what you want
	to add, since there may be some changed files that aren't ready to be committed
	yet or aren't part of the logical change you're currently implementing.
